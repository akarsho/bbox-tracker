# BBox Tracker
### Description
BBox tracker was originally a project made for my school's Arduino Club, but I decided to do some makeovers and make it a bit more efficient this time around.

Essentially, The BBox tracker is a telescope/camera tracker that uses bounding boxes to point the camera directly at the object. It's made to handle small movements, such as in astrophotography and astronomy. 

This idea was inspired by [adrian154](https://github.com/adrian154), so take a look at his projects as well!
